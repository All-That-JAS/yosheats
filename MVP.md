Our goal is to create a web app that recommends nutritional goals for users based on health and demographic info and tracks their progress on these goals. Users will be able to input foods, including recipes, that they consume throughout the day. The app will recommend foods to help the user meet their goals. We will add gamifying incentives (badges, bonuses, pet, etc.) for users with data visualization. We will be using GraphQL, PWA, and React to accomplish this.
